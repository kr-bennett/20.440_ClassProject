# 20.440_ClassProject
## Identifying risk biomarkers for future ischemic stroke using scRNA-seq mouse brain vascular transcriptomes

## Overview
This repository contains code, data, and figures related to the Spring 2022 20.440 Class Project between Kimberly Bennett and Chau Vo.

## Data
Data was not generated by the authors of this project and were sourced from the EMBL-EBI database: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/experiments/E-GEOD-98816/downloads?geneId=ENSMUSG00000062991&markerGeneK=11&k=11&colourBy=genotype&plotType=tsne&plotOption=20

## Folder structure
The following folders and their contents can be found in this repository:
- Data
-   Original file containing clusters of vasculature genes (Vasculature_Clustering_File.csv) 
-     Currently not in use but uploaded for future use
-   Original file of Normalised Counts of gene expression across cell samples in cpm (E-GEOD-98816.aggregated_filtered_normalised_counts.mtx)
- Code
-   Juptyer Notebooks Code for a preliminary version of a figure needed for PSET 4 (Bennett_Kimberly_pset4code.ipynb)
-   Python Script for a preliminary version of a figure needed for PSET 4 (Bennett_Kimberly_pset4code.py)
- Figures
-   Preliminary figure of a Heatmap of gene expression of the top 500 genes across 3186 cell samples.

## Installation
Code for this project is written in Python using the Jupyter Notebooks web-based application and figures were generated with this code. Both python scripts and juptyer notebook files are uploaded for use.
